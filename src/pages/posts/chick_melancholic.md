# The melancholic chicken 1889
## Josef Karel Šlejhar
Little Lojzík, whose mother was struck and killed by lightening, lives on a farm with his father and their old manservant. He perceives the raw surrounding world as images promising him his mother's lost embrace. The young boy searches in vain for someone out of all those near him to connect with. He can't get support and security from his father, from his mother's sister, nor even from his stepmother who, at least at the beginning, sympathized with his troubles. The only one, in fact, with whom Lojzík can share his lonely fate as an abandoned young one is an ordinary chicken.


## Where does it come from?
Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
